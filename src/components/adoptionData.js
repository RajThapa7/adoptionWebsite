        desc:"Each year, hundreds or even thousands of adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet.\n\nThe number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopt pets instead of buying them. When you adopt dogs and cats, you save a loving animal by making them part of your family and open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it."

        desc:"If you buy a dog from a pet store, online seller or flea market, you're almost certainly getting a dog from a puppy mill. Puppy mills are industrial-style breeding facilities that put profit before the well-being of dogs. Puppy mills animals are housed in surprisingly poor conditions with improper medical care and are often very sick and behaviorally disrupted as a result.\n\nThe moms of these puppies are kept in cages to be bred over and over for years, without human companionship and with little hope of ever joining a family. And after they're no longer profitable, breeding dogs are simply discarded—either killed, abandoned or sold at auction. \n\nThese puppy mills continue to stay in business through deceptive tactics — their customers are unsuspecting consumers who shop in pet stores, over the Internet or through classified ads. Puppy mills will continue to operate until people stop supporting them. By adopting a pet, you can be certain you aren't giving them a dime."

A sense of joy takes over you when you realize that you actually made those little ones feel worthy, you’ll definitely feel pride seeping into your heart. The heart that chose an animal that needed a home rather than an animal that was created for homes. "
